bashgit clone https://github.com/waybetterengineering/octave.git
cd octave

Create and activate a virtual environment:

bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade numpy pint

For OBD support, ensure you have permissions to access the Bluetooth device:

bashsudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
(You may need to log out and back in for this to take effect)

For equalizer functionality, install EasyEffects:

bashflatpak install flathub com.github.wwmm.easyeffects

Launch the application:

bashpython main.py
macOS Installation

Open Terminal
Navigate to your desired installation location:

bashcd ~/Documents

Clone the repository and enter the directory:

bashgit clone https://github.com/waybetterengineering/octave.git
cd octave

Create and activate a virtual environment:

bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

bashpython main.py
OBD-II Configuration
To use OBD-II features:

Pair your Bluetooth OBD-II adapter with your computer
In OCTAVE, go to Settings > OBD Settings
Enter the Bluetooth device path:

Windows: Usually "COM3" (check Device Manager)
Linux: Usually "/dev/rfcomm0"
macOS: Usually "/dev/tty.OBDLinkMX-STN-SPP-1"


Enable or disable Fast Mode depending on your vehicle's compatibility
Customize which OBD parameters to display on the home screen

Media Player

Add your music files to the default media folder or configure a custom music folder in Settings > Media Settings
The player supports MP3 files with album art and metadata
Create and save equalizer presets for different audio preferences
Toggle shuffle mode to randomize playback

Customizing the Interface

Go to Settings > Display Settings
Choose from built-in themes or create your own custom theme
Adjust UI scaling to fit your screen
Modify clock format and visibility

System Requirements

Minimum screen resolution: 800x480 (recommended: 1280x720 or higher)
2GB RAM minimum
For OBD functionality: Bluetooth-enabled OBD-II adapter
For optimal equalizer performance: System-level equalizer software

Troubleshooting

OBD Connection Issues: Check Bluetooth pairing and device path
Media Not Playing: Verify file formats (MP3) and folder permissions
Missing Album Art: Ensure MP3 files have embedded album art
Performance Issues: Adjust UI scaling and background blur settings
