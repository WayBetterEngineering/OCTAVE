# OCTAVE

## Overview
[OCTAVE](https://octave.waybetterengineering.com/) (Open-source Cross-platform Telematics for Augmented Vehicle Experience) is a solution to having a fully automatable infotainment center in your vehicle. While OCTAVE could theoretically work in any vehicle, it best suits older cars with dilapidated infotainment systems. We were always left seeking more from the infotainment systems in our cars, so we wanted to develop a solution that could be extremely feature-rich. We also wanted to be able to see all the OBD data coming from the vehicle while still being able to play music and all that good stuff.

OCTAVE is designed to be cross-platform so that the method of installing into a car is up to the user. Most would likely choose a Raspberry Pi or equivalent and some sort of smaller touchscreen, grabbing power from the car, a 3D printed mount for the screen, and a way to interface into your speakers and you're good to go! However, this can be run on Windows, Mac, and Linux alike, which makes for a really easy way to code and test new features, or if you really wanted to, you could have a Windows or Mac based device embedded in your vehicle.

This app was designed to be easy to work with, so it has a Python backend with a QML based front end. There's also a settings configuration JSON file that's used to save all customizable features within the app, so everything you change stays changed and you can rock the app exactly as you like.

Updates for this project happen fast commits will contain the date to signify when things where last touched. Please feel free to reach out if you think this is cool or if you think its lame you can tell me all about it rob@waybetterengineering.com

## System Requirements
- For now, I've successfully tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3 running Bookworm

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- All required packages listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file

---

### Windows Installation

1. Open Command Prompt as administrator or PowerShell with elevated privileges:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. Navigate to your desired installation location:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents
   ```

3. Clone the repository and enter the directory:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/waybetterengineering/octave.git
   cd octave
   ```

4. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```cmd
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install --upgrade numpy pint
   ```

6. For equalizer support, install Equalizer APO for system-wide equalizer support.

7. Launch the application:
   ```cmd
   python main.py
   ```

---

### Linux Installation

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to your desired installation location:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   ```

3. Clone the repository and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waybetterengineering/octave.git
   cd octave
   ```

4. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install --upgrade numpy pint
   ```

6. For OBD support, ensure you have permissions to access the Bluetooth device:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
   ```
   (You may need to log out and back in for this to take effect.)

7. For equalizer functionality, install EasyEffects:
   ```bash
   flatpak install flathub com.github.wwmm.easyeffects
   ```
